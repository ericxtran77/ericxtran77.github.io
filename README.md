I am a computer science major at CSUF and I hope on graduating in 2026

## Favroite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6
This lab is the least favorite out of three, but still I enjoy this lab more than the other labs not listed here. Lab 6 introduces the many usages of if statements like checking the argument lines, making certain
conditions passable, and excluding some conditions. Part 1 was very simple, making some changes to the sandwich file including if statements. Part 2 was complicated because the code requires a lot of if statements
and very long and complex conditions to be fulfilled. Overall, this lab has broadened my understanding of if statements and how to work my way through.

Lab 9
This lab is my second favorite, though it left me feeling uncertain about some things, questioning my capability. Lab 9 introduces me for loops and the usage and function of it. Part 1 was a little complicated at
first, but with my understanding of for loops currently I was able to understand using for loops to exclude the minimum and maximum. Part 2 was a bit complex with using for loops and if statements all together and
how the loop searches for schedules containing the letter ‘e’ and breaking if so. Overall, this lab has also broadened my understanding on for loops and how to utilize it when coding.

Lab 12
Despite being the last lab of the class, I expected this to be really hard to complete, but now I completely enjoyed this lab because of the animation. This lab introduces Magick++ and how to make an animation or
gif file that works. Part 1 was about creating moving colors, making them gradient frame by frame. I got most of the coding down and needed a little help with some compiling errors. Part 2 was similar to part 1,
involving a gif and seeing the animation. Like part 1, part 2 has similar functions and so carrying that helps me set up very quickly. Overall, the lab was unexpectedly the most fun and I may actually hope that we
get to see more animation coding as I am interested in majoring that.
